Todo:
  ☐ Refactor project because it's the start of the (new) boilerplate
  ☐ Make unit tests work with the .yml files
  ☐ Setup voice get price calls
  ☐ Change API to have descriptions of the patterns.
  ☐ Add explanation, what do the strategies mean.
    ☐ Loop through strategies
    ☐ Create a nice message after the loop
    ☐ Another option: only do the pattern_prediction with description of the pattern.
