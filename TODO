Todo:
  ☐ Make unit tests work with the .yml files
  ☐ Setup voice structure to get price details calls. Like: "What is the price of Bitcoin?"
  ☐ implement as voice command https://technical-analysis-api.com/api/v1/pattern/hasHeadAndShoulder?apiKey=xxx
  ☐ Add explanation, what do the strategies mean.
    ☐ Loop through strategies
    ☐ Create a nice message after the loop
    ☐ Another option: only do the pattern_prediction with description of the pattern.
  ☐ Build a way to fetch more information when the user already asked about a coin.
    ☐ What is the price
    ☐ Should I buy it
    ☐ more information, this will tell what patterns it found etc
